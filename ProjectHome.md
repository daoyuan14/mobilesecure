## Introduction ##

MobileSecure is a Secure System for Privacy Protection based on Android.

This project has two part: client part based on Android, and server part based on GAE.

Our server could control mobile client remotely by the auto SMS commands sending to client. In this way, we achieve the access control for private data. Once the phone is stolen or lost, users can log our server to send control commands to lock stolen mobile phones, backup and delete privacy data remotely. Moreover, we also have a Location-Tracking module, which will records the current geographical location of stolen mobile phones constantly.
